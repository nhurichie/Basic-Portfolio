        my name is nhu richie. i am a vietnamese adoptee from minneapolis, minnesota. i am inquisitive to a fault, have a persistent desire to learn, and am genuinely curious for why things are they way they are. i would like to think i am a hard worker but i do try not to take myself too seriously. i am also quite short and a terrible basketball player. what a useless stump. what i lack in dribbling and free-throw skills though, i more than make up for my bodacious smile and personality. i'd like to think that i am a lover of love, a storyteller, and a random fact monger. when i'm not just lounging around on a sunday morning eating pancakes, i like to explore the spirit of fun by tackling the country be it on bike or foot; adventuring outdoors; attemting to climb rocks; eating a plain raised glazed doughnut from bogart's doughtnuts (hands down the best in the twin cities!); and getting my face lost in a stack of books. besides relishing in the things i enjoy day-by-day, there are things i am passionate about that are outside of me. one of them is less social media, more social justice and traveling to understand cultures, the diversity of the world, and cannot forget to mention the deliciousness of food.</p>
